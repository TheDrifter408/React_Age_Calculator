## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

The above 2 images was taken on firefox which does not support -webkit- classes due to which the -webkit-inner-spin-button, -webkit-outer-spin-button are not supported by it.

This was taken on a brave browser which does support -webkit- classes and as such no outer/inner-spin-button was seen.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was my second project on frontend Mentor and I learned more about css grid and flexbox, The trickiest part of the project was animating the numbers for which I had help from a youtube video and found another resource to help in the formula for the age calculator. Got a hands-on of what an HTMLCollection is and how to work with it.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on animating the numbers more smoothly, (maybe adding a fade-in or something of the sort) as that I feel would go with the design a bit more.

### Useful resources

- [Animating Numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfDIU93fN3o) - This helped me to animate the numbers and complete the bonus challenge.
- [Age calculator](https://www.javatpoint.com/calculate-age-using-javascript) - This website helped to make the age calculator more accurate and specific as requried by the challenge.
